* Review of Joe's code

* Reviewed by Jeffery Wu

After coming to the consensus, with my previous partner that we should be modifying a file, instead of dealing with inputs and outputs that are strings, I reviewed Joe's code to see if he followed those standards. He printed the formatted string, rather than modifying the file, so we justified why modifying the file would be a better option. Then we compared the algorithms we used for the formatting. We figured out that we used the same steps, but just in a different order and decided that it wasn't that important, but it was good to try to analyze the alogrithms and apply some logical thinking.
